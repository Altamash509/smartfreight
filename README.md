End-to-end data engineering project for logistics optimization
ðŸš€ SmartFreight: Logistics Cost Optimization Platform
Project Overview
This project aims to build an end-to-end data engineering platform for a U.S.-based third-party logistics (3PL) company. The primary goal is to optimize freight costs by providing a unified, near real-time view of shipment performance, delays, spoilage, and cost overruns.

ðŸ§  Business Context
Our client, a 3PL company, manages freight shipments for major retailers. They face significant challenges with:

High spoilage and late delivery costs: Leading to financial losses and customer dissatisfaction.

Suboptimal carrier selection: Lacking data-driven insights to choose the most efficient and cost-effective carriers.

Limited performance analysis: Inability to easily analyze performance by lane, carrier, and product type.

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
The current process for freight cost performance review is manual, relying on analysts pulling data from disparate sources (carrier APIs, shipment tracking platforms, invoice systems) into Excel. This process is often weeks behind, preventing timely decision-making.

The company urgently needs an automated, near real-time data platform to:

Track shipment delays, spoilage, and cost overruns effectively.

Predict risk factors by region, product type, and carrier to enable proactive intervention.

Provide reliable and timely cost metrics to logistics and finance teams for strategic optimization.

ðŸŽ¯ Business Goals
Goal

Description

1. Ingest Multi-Source Freight Data

Combine data from various APIs (carrier tracking, invoices, ERP).

2. Model Performance Data

Build robust dimensional models (e.g., dim_carrier, dim_product, dim_region, dim_time).

3. Create Loss Metrics

Identify key performance indicators like spoilage percentage, average cost overrun, and on-time delivery rate.

4. Automate Daily Pipeline

Orchestrate the entire Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) process using Python scripts (and optionally scheduled jobs).

5. Deliver Insights to Ops & Finance

Push clean, tested, and modeled data to a data warehouse for BI dashboarding
